# Monkeytype-Clone
 A simplified Monkeytype clone.

# Usage
- This project utilises the Markov bigram text generator I built for its typing test generation. The link to that repository is here:
  https://github.com/akshatk-khurana/Markov-Bigram-Text-Generator
- Running this project involves running the main.py file found in the above repository (the simple API backend) and then clicking on this [link]([url](https://akshatk-khurana.github.io/Monkeytype-Clone/)) to the front-end which is hosted on GitHub pages.
