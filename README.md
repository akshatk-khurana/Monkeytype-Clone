# Monkeytype-Clone
 A simplified Monkeytype clone, which tries to imitate the Monkeytype tying experience to a high degree, as well as the UI.

# Usage
This project utilises the [Markov Bigram Text Generator](https://akshatk-khurana.github.io/Monkeytype-Clone/) I built for its typing test generation. 

To run this project:
Download the zipped source code of the above mentioned text generator and extract the main.py file. After running it as specified in its README.md, do the following:
- Go to the [frontend](https://akshatk-khurana.github.io/Monkeytype-Clone/) of this clone (hosted on Github pages) to the front-end which is hosted on GitHub pages.

- Type away and utilise the menu to change how many words you are given to type!
